# MotoDataLogger (API IN PROGRESS)

**MotoDataLogger** is an **Android-based motorcycle tracking system** powered by the **Automate** app. It captures real-time sensor data from an Android device and structures it into a JSON request for future API integration. The idea is to be able to use an older or unused android device for tracking motorcycle or any other vehicle. The system will also implement the alarm system which will warn user if any of the sensors values changed beyond threshold.  

## 📌 Features  

✔ **Real-time Data Logging** – Collects essential ride data, including:  
  - 📍 GPS location & speed  
  - ☀ Ambient light levels  
  - 📊 Acceleration & orientation  
  - 🔋 Battery status  
  - 🌡 Temperature & humidity  
  - 🧲 Magnetic field readings  

✔ **JSON Data Generation** – Prepares structured JSON output for seamless API integration.  

✔ **Flexible & Customizable** – Modify the **Automate** flow directly on your phone, no coding required!  

## 🔧 Requirements  

- **Android device** with the [Automate](https://llamalab.com/automate/) app  
- **Location services enabled** for GPS tracking  
- **Paid version recommended** (Automate app flow file may exceed free version limits)  

## 🚀 Future Enhancements  

- **.NET API integration** for real-time data transmission
- **Live tracking dashboard**

- **JSON Data Generation:**
  The collected data is structured into a **JSON request** for potential transmission to an API server (planned **.NET API** integration).
